- 👋 Hi, I’m @JJHotty Really (Jas)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, and creating things from a tiny spark of an idea, to a concept, right to a full blown program.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning heaps. I am growing a lot everyday.. And though it seems that I'm always jumping from place to place.. I seem to be making some traction. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something that has patient developers who are keen to mentor (I have a lot to learn yet). 
- 📫 How to reach me @jas.jjhotty@gmail.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: I currently work as an installation expert (technician) similar to geeksquad. Installing TV's, Networks, Computers and the like. But I desire to one day be a full time developer.
